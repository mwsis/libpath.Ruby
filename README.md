### Related projects

**libpath.Ruby** is based on the [C/C++ libpath library](https://github.com/synesissoftware/libpath), which itself was prompted by a request on the [STLSoft](https://github.com/synesissoftware/STLSoft-1.10) project by my friend and esteemed programmer [Adi Shavit](https://github.com/adishavit).

**libpath.Ruby** will be used in **version 3+** of the **[recls.Ruby](https://github.com/synesissoftware/recls.Ruby)** library, which currently has its own path-parsing logic.
